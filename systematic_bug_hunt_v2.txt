SYSTEMATIC BUG HUNT v2.0 - Finding and Fixing Hidden Issues

This document transforms general bug hunting into specific, measurable investigations that produce actionable findings and prevent regressions.

## Bug Hunt Framework

### Investigation Process
1. **Hypothesis**: What might be broken?
2. **Test Design**: How to reproduce/detect?
3. **Measurement**: Concrete metrics and thresholds
4. **Deliverable**: Bug report with reproduction steps
5. **Prevention**: Automated test to catch regression

### Bug Severity Matrix
- **Critical**: Causes data loss, crashes, or >20ms latency
- **High**: Breaks core functionality or degrades performance
- **Medium**: Affects user experience or causes confusion
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues or edge cases

## SYSTEMATIC BUG INVESTIGATIONS

### STEP 1: Race Condition Detection in Practice Mode
**Goal**: Find timing-dependent bugs in rapid MIDI input scenarios
**Actions**:
- Create automated test harness simulating rapid note sequences
- Test scenarios:
  - 10 notes within 100ms (glissando)
  - Simultaneous chord + single note
  - Note-off arriving before note-on (hardware glitch)
  - Practice evaluation during state transitions
- Monitor for:
  - Missed note evaluations
  - Incorrect chord detection
  - State update collisions
  - React render timing issues
- Use Chrome DevTools Performance profiler during tests
**Deliverable**: Race condition inventory with timing diagrams
**Success Criteria**: Zero missed evaluations at 100 notes/second

### STEP 2: Memory Leak Investigation
**Goal**: Identify and fix memory growth over extended sessions
**Actions**:
- Instrument app with performance.memory tracking
- Create automated 1-hour practice session simulation:
  - Load/unload 10 different scores
  - Play 1000+ MIDI events
  - Switch practice modes repeatedly
  - Connect/disconnect MIDI devices
- Take heap snapshots at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes
- Analyze for:
  - Detached DOM nodes (OSMD elements)
  - Retained event listeners
  - Growing arrays/sets
  - Unclosed audio contexts
  - Zombie React components
- Review all useEffect cleanups in src/renderer/
**Deliverable**: Memory leak report with heap analysis
**Success Criteria**: <200MB heap after 1 hour, zero growth trend

### STEP 3: Edge Case Inventory - Malformed Input
**Goal**: Test robustness against invalid/unusual data
**Test Matrix**:
- MusicXML files:
  - Empty file
  - Missing required elements
  - 10MB+ file size
  - Unicode in titles/lyrics
  - Corrupted ZIP structure
  - Circular references
- Musical edge cases:
  - 32nd note triplets at 200 BPM
  - 15/16 time signature
  - 1000+ measure composition
  - Microtonal accidentals
  - Multiple simultaneous tempo changes
- MIDI input:
  - Invalid note numbers (>127)
  - Velocity = 0 as note-off

**Deliverable**: Edge case handling matrix
**Success Criteria**: Graceful handling, no crashes, clear error messages

### STEP 4: Cross-Platform Compatibility Testing
**Goal**: Identify platform-specific bugs
**Test Environments**:
- Windows 10/11 + ASIO drivers
- macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- Common Linux distros (Ubuntu, Fedora)
**Test Areas**:
- MIDI device enumeration
- Audio latency with different drivers
- File system paths (spaces, Unicode)
- GPU acceleration for OSMD rendering
- Memory usage patterns
- IPC performance differences
**Deliverable**: Platform compatibility matrix
**Success Criteria**: <20ms latency on all platforms, no platform-specific crashes

### STEP 5: State Synchronization Validation
**Goal**: Find mismatches between UI and internal state
**Test Scenarios**:
- Rapid practice mode switching
- MIDI input during state transitions
- Browser dev tools state manipulation
- Network latency simulation (for future features)
- Multiple browser tabs (if supported)
**Detection Methods**:
- Add state checksum validation
- Log all Zustand state transitions
- Compare UI elements with store state
- Track render count vs state updates
**Deliverable**: State sync violation report
**Success Criteria**: UI always reflects current state, no stale renders

### STEP 6: Error Recovery Testing
**Goal**: Verify graceful degradation and recovery
**Failure Scenarios**:
- MIDI device disconnection mid-session
- Audio context suspension (browser policy)
- File system permissions revoked
- Out of memory conditions
- Graphics driver crash (OSMD rendering)
- Corrupt user preferences
**Recovery Requirements**:
- Clear error messages
- Automatic retry where appropriate
- State preservation across errors
- One-click recovery actions
**Deliverable**: Error recovery test matrix
**Success Criteria**: 90% of errors recoverable without restart

### STEP 7: Performance Degradation Profiling
**Goal**: Detect operations that slow down over time
**Monitoring Points**:
- MIDI event processing time
- React component render duration
- OSMD cursor update latency
- Zustand state update time
- IPC round-trip time
**Test Protocol**:
- Baseline measurements at start
- Continuous monitoring for 2 hours
- Alert on >10% degradation
- Profile heap/CPU at degradation points
**Deliverable**: Performance degradation report
**Success Criteria**: <5% performance loss over 2-hour session

### STEP 8: Concurrency Bug Detection
**Goal**: Find bugs in parallel operations
**Test Scenarios**:
- Multiple file uploads simultaneously
- MIDI input during file loading
- Practice mode evaluation during score rendering
- Settings changes during playback
- Worker thread communication under load
**Detection Tools**:
- Thread sanitizer for native modules

- Promises without .catch handlers
- Event handlers that swallow errors

## KEY PRINCIPLES

- **Measure, Don't Guess**: Every bug needs quantifiable impact
- **Automate Detection**: Manual testing doesn't scale
- **Reproduce First**: No fix without reproduction steps
- **Prevent Regression**: Every fix includes a test
- **User Impact Focus**: Prioritize by real user pain

Remember: The best bugs to fix are the ones that never ship. This systematic approach catches issues before users experience them.
