## PHASE GATE REVIEW PROCESS

**Participants**: Feature owner, tech lead, product manager, QA lead

**Outcomes**:
- **Proceed**: Move to next phase
- **Iterate**: Address specific concerns (1 iteration max)
- **Pivot**: Major approach change needed
- **Archive**: Feature not viable with current constraints

**Latency Hard Stop**: Any feature consistently exceeding 20ms total latency must pivot or be archived.

## PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK

**Priority Score** = (User Value × Urgency) / (Risk Score × Effort)

**Suggested Order**:
1. Latency Optimization (enabler for all features)
2. Smart Practice Mode (core value prop)
3. Practice Recording (low risk, high value)
4. Performance Analytics (supports practice mode)
5. Advanced Score Analysis (enhances practice)
6. Adaptive Tempo (depends on optimization)
7. Sheet Music Management (quality of life)
8. AI Features (high risk, unclear ROI)
9. Plugin Architecture (future platform)
10. Multiplayer (highest risk, niche use)

## KEY PRINCIPLES

- **Latency First**: Every decision evaluated against <20ms target
- **Fail Fast**: PoCs designed to surface blockers quickly
- **User Value**: Features must improve learning outcomes
- **Incremental Progress**: Ship thin slices that work
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Document failures for future reference

Remember: Research without implementation constraints leads to analysis paralysis. This framework ensures every investigation produces actionable next steps.
